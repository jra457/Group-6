## Description

Our ecommerce site Knockoff King is based on our aspirations to build a more ethical online market to rival existing sites. It is a part of the growing trend moving away from the traditional brick and mortar stores to an online platform. Knockoff King is aimed at helping small business owners maintain profitability by giving their employees new freedom and transitioning to an online platform.  

The frontend will be designed with Bootstrap which incorporates HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Frontend design will be the user interface that buyers, sellers and admins interact with when navigating/using Knockoff King. By contrast, the backend will be built with Python based Django, which will bridge the connection between HTML and our SQL database.
